Interested in AI, its applications to science, and its relationship with society.

I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Waterloo working at the intersection of AI and science. Previosuly, I was a ML engineer at <a href="https://www.gandeeva.com/"><u>Gandeeva Therapeutics</u></a>, where I designed proteins and <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2023/07/developments-in-ml-for-antibody-design"><u>antibodies</u></a>. 

For my Ph.D., I worked with the computational biology group at Simon Fraser University, while also being funded by UBC. At the <a href="https://www.libbrechtlab.com"><u>Libbrecht lab</u></a>, I designed representation learning strategies for <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/hiclstm"><u>chromatin structure</u></a> and the <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/epilstm"><u>epigenome</u></a>. Before my Ph.D., I completed my M.A.Sc while working with the information theory group at UBC. During this time, I interned with Skycope Technologies to build their <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/frcnn"><u>automatic drone detection software</u></a>. I also have experience using machine learning in a variety of settings like <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/projects/privateml"><u>privacy preservation</u></a>, and <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/projects/vaelm"><u>variational language models</u></a>.

Education
======
* Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (<span style="color:#2C4381">Thesis: Representation Learning Strategies for the Epigenome and Chromatin Structure using Recurrent Neural Models)</span>, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, 2023 
* M.A.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, 2018
* B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Enginnering, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India, 2017 

Work experience
======
* ## NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Waterloo <span style="color:#2C4381">(Oct 2024 - Present)</span> 
  * Consulting on multiple projects in AI for science. 
* ## Researcher, Royal Bank of Canada <span style="color:#2C4381">(July 2024 - Present)</span> 
  * LLM's + evolutionary strategies for spatial optimization using heuristics. 
  * Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) for learning local natural language heuristics to mimic global graph optimization problems.  
* ## Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Waterloo <span style="color:#2C4381">(Oct 2023 - Present)</span>
  * Developing AI models for decision making regarding boreal afforestation in Canada. 
* ## AI Consultant, Stealth Startups <span style="color:#2C4381">(Jun 2023 - Sep 2023)</span> 
  * Designed an AI framework for metal-organic framework (MOF) discovery for carbon capture and storage applications 
  * Explored mutational landscape of carbonic anhydrase using DL methods 
* ## Machine Learning Engineer, <a href="https://www.gandeeva.com/"><u>Gandeeva Therapeutics</u></a> <span style="color:#2C4381">(Feb 2023 - May 2023)</span> 
  * Integrated molecular dynamics based conformation search with deep learning based protein design for protein affinity maturation. Gandeeva will use this platform for their future protein affinity maturation campaigns.
  * Tested interface scoring tools from CASP15 to drive in-house ppi prediction, which will significantly improve Gandeevaâ€™s target discovery efforts.
  * Tested proof-of-concept target-potential binding partner interface recovery by using protein design to suggest favourable mutations. This will help Gandeeva recover weak but therapeutically relevant interfaces.

* ## Ph.D. Candidate, The University of British Columbia <span style="color:#2C4381">(Jan 2019 - Feb 2023)</span> 
  * Designed representation learning strategies for the <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/epilstm"><u>epigenome</u></a> and <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/hiclstm"><u>chromatin structure</u></a>.
  * Tested representations for tasks like pan-celltype element identification, novel element detection, transfer learning to unseen cell types, inference of 3D chromatin structure, and simulating in-silico alterations.

* ## Machine Learning Intern, <a href="https://www.gandeeva.com/"><u>Gandeeva Therapeutics</u></a> <span style="color:#2C4381">(Jun 2022 - Dec 2022)</span> 
  * Designed antibodies using sequence and structure based Machine Learning, antibody folding tools, rosetta energy metrics, and bayesian optimization.

* ## Machine Learning Intern, <a href="https://www.skycope.com/"><u>Skycope Technologies</u></a> <span style="color:#2C4381"> (May 2018 - Sep 2018)</span>
  * Built Skycope's data and machine learning infrastructure.
  * Modified Faster-RCNN, an existing object detection framework, to successfully <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/frcnn"><u>detect and locate drone signals in the spectrogram</u></a>.
  * Integrated ML into Skycope's existing software stack, which is now it's flagship drone detection software.

* ## M.A.Sc. Research Assistant, The University of British Columbia <span style="color:#2C4381"> (Sep 2017 - Dec 2018)</span>
  * Developed deep learning frameworks for signal detection and hybrid precoding schemes for sequential data.
