Hi, welcome to my site! Get in touch if you think I'm a good fit for a role or just want to chat.   

Previosuly, I was a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.gandeeva.com/"><u>Gandeeva Therapeutics</u></a>, where I used machine learning to understand and design biomolecules. I was involved in multiple projects at Gandeeva including using sequence and structure based Machine Learning to design antibodies, integrating molecular dynamics with protein design tools for protein affinity maturation, and validating state of the art protein interface scoring tools for target discovery. 

For my Ph.D., I worked with the computational biology group at Simon Fraser University, while also being funded by UBC. At the <a href="https://www.libbrechtlab.com"><u>Libbrecht lab</u></a>, I designed representation learning strategies for the <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/epilstm"><u>epigenome</u></a> and <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/hiclstm"><u>chromatin structure</u></a>. Before my Ph.D., I completed my M.A.Sc while working with the information theory group at UBC. During this time, I interned with Skycope Technologies to build their <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/frcnn"><u>automatic drone detection software</u></a>. I also have demonstrated experience using machine learning in a variety of settings like <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/projects/privateml"><u>privacy preservation</u></a>, and <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/projects/vaelm"><u>variational language models</u></a>.

Apart from the above, I spend most of my time thinking about and engaging in isues related to climate change, including (a) computational materials/enzyme engineering that can enhance carbon sequestration or be used for Direct Air Capture (DAC), b) <a href="https://www.ai4climatecoop.org/"><u>international collaboration on climate ploicy using AI</u></a>, and (c) designing alternative economic systems for the future. 

You can reach out to me if you want to discuss any of the above.
