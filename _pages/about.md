Hi, welcome to my site. I am a generalist who enjoys solving challenging problems. Primarily, I'm an AI engineer and researcher, helping organizations and businesses become AI native. I am broadly interested in computation and AI ([1](https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2025/05/arion-nanogpt), [2](https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2025/02/on-knowledge-and-substrate), [3](https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2024/09/perspectives-on-the-future-of-AI)), their infusion in products and software ([1](https://github.com/kevinbdsouza)), their applications to science ([1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31337-w), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19846), [3](https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2022/11/developments-in-ml-for-antibody-design), [4](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9075413)), their role in scientific discovery ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20412)), and their relationship with society ([1](https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2025/03/ai-and-labour)).
