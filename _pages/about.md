Hi, welcome to my site. I am a generalist who enjoys solving challenging problems. Currently, I'm a researcher at the University of Waterloo working on AI for science. I am broadly interested in computation and AI (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2025/02/on-knowledge-and-substrate"><u>1</u></a>, <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2024/09/perspectives-on-the-future-of-AI"><u>2</u></a>, <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2024/12/enhancing-factual-accuracy-in-large-language-models"><u>3</u></a>), their applications to science (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31337-w"><u>1</u></a>, <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2022/11/developments-in-ml-for-antibody-design"><u>2</u></a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9075413"><u>3</u></a>), their role in scientific discovery, and their relationship with society (<a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2025/03/ai-and-labour"><u>1</u></a>).
