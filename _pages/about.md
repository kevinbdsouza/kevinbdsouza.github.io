Hi, welcome to my site!

I am actively looking for roles in the UK and Europe. Get in touch if you think I'm a good fit for a role or just want to chat about Computational Biology, Drug Discovery and Machine Learning.   

Currently, I am a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.gandeeva.com/"><u>Gandeeva Therapeutics</u></a> working on using machine learning to understand and design biomolecules. Before joining full time, I worked at Gandeeva as a Protein Design Intern. During this time, I used sequence and structure based Machine Learning to design antibodies. 

For my Ph.D., I worked with the computational biology group at Simon Fraser University, while also being funded by UBC. At the <a href="https://www.libbrechtlab.com"><u>Libbrecht lab</u></a>, I worked on building representations for the genome. My thesis studied learning strategies that can design representations for the <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/epilstm"><u>epigenome</u></a> and <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/hiclstm"><u>chromatin structure</u></a>. These representations are useful for a variety of tasks like pan-celltype element identification, novel element detection, transfer learning to unseen cell types, inference of 3D chromatin structure, and in-silico modifications. The software for my research is written in Python using PyTorch and CUDA. The software packages resulting from this work are available on <a href="https://github.com/kevinbdsouza"><u>GitHub</u></a>. 

Before my Ph.D., I completed my M.A.Sc while working with the information theory group at UBC. During this time, I interned with Skycope Technologies to build their data and machine learning infrastructure, a <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/frcnn"><u>computer vision based signal detection framework</u></a>, which they are now using as a flagship service in their automatic drone detection software. Apart from the above, I also have demonstrated experience using machine learning in a variety of settings like <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/projects/privateml"><u>privacy preservation</u></a>, and <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/projects/vaelm"><u>variational language models</u></a>.

Apart from my research, I spend most of my time thinking about and engaging in isues related to climate change, including (a) <a href="https://www.ai4climatecoop.org/"><u>international collaboration on climate ploicy using AI</u></a>, (b) computational protein/enzyme engineering that can enhance carbon sequestration, and (c) designing alternative economic systems for the future. 

You can reach out to me if you want to discuss any of the above, or any other ideas you may find interesting.
