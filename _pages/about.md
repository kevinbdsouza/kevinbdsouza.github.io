Hi, welcome to my site! Currently, I'm part of a team that is building AI methods to discover materials for a sustainable future (stay tuned). Get in touch if you want to chat about AI for climate change or sustainibility. 

I spend most of my time thinking about and engaging in isues related to climate change, including (a) computational materials engineering for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) or direct air capture (DAC), and b) <a href="https://www.ai4climatecoop.org/"><u>international collaboration on climate ploicy using AI</u></a>. 

Previosuly, I was a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.gandeeva.com/"><u>Gandeeva Therapeutics</u></a>, where I used machine learning to understand and design biomolecules. I was involved in multiple projects at Gandeeva including <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/posts/2023/07/developments-in-ml-for-antibody-design"><u>designing antibodies</u></a> using sequence and structure based machine learning and protein affinity maturation integrating molecular dynamics with deep learning based protein design. 

For my Ph.D., I worked with the computational biology group at Simon Fraser University, while also being funded by UBC. At the <a href="https://www.libbrechtlab.com"><u>Libbrecht lab</u></a>, I designed representation learning strategies for the <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/epilstm"><u>epigenome</u></a> and <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/hiclstm"><u>chromatin structure</u></a>. Before my Ph.D., I completed my M.A.Sc while working with the information theory group at UBC. During this time, I interned with Skycope Technologies to build their <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/publications/frcnn"><u>automatic drone detection software</u></a>. I also have demonstrated experience using machine learning in a variety of settings like <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/projects/privateml"><u>privacy preservation</u></a>, and <a href="https://kevinbdsouza.github.io/projects/vaelm"><u>variational language models</u></a>.
