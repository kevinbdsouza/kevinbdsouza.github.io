title: "Assessing the climate benefits of afforestation: phenomenology, processes, methods"
collection: publications
status: preprint
permalink: /publications/hiclstm
excerpt: "Afforestation greatly influences several earth system processes, making it essential to understand these effects to accurately assess its potential for climate change mitigation. Although our understanding of forest-climate interactions has improved, significant knowledge gaps remain, preventing definitive assessments of afforestation's net climate benefits. In this review, focusing on the Canadian boreal, we identify these gaps and synthesize existing knowledge. The review highlights regional realities, Earth's climatic history, uncertainties in biogeochemical (BGC) and biogeophysical (BGP) changes following afforestation, and limitations in current assessment methodologies, emphasizing the need to reconcile these uncertainties before drawing firm conclusions about the climate benefits of afforestation. We hope that the identified gaps will drive the development of a more informed decision-making framework for Canadian afforestation policy, one that considers regional and future climatic contexts. Although we use the Canadian boreal as an example, most arguments in this review are applicable across the globe, particularly for the circumpolar nations."
