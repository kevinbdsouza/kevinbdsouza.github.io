excerpt: "Agricultural landscapes face the dual challenge of sustaining food production while reversing biodiversity loss. Agri-environmental policies often fall short of delivering ecological functions such as landscape connectivity, in part due to a persistent disconnect between farm-level economic decisions and landscape-scale spatial planning. We introduce a novel hierarchical optimization framework that bridges this gap. First, an Ecological Intensification (EI) model determines the economically optimal allocation of land to margin and habitat interventions at the individual farm level. These farm-specific intervention levels are then passed to an Ecological Connectivity (EC) model, which spatially arranges them across the landscape to maximize connectivity while preserving farm-level profitability. Finally, we introduce a Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach that translates these spatial outcomes into simple, cost effective, and scalable policy instruments, such as subsidies and eco-premiums, using non-spatial, farm-level policy parameters. Applying the framework to a Canadian agricultural landscape, we demonstrate how it enhances connectivity under real-world economic constraints. Our approach provides a globally relevant tool for aligning farm incentives with biodiversity goals, advancing the development of agri-environmental policies that are economically viable and ecologically effective."
